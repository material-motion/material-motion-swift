/**
 A motion runtime provides a mechanism for associating interactions with targets.

 Runtimes are cheap to create and scoped a specific view hierarchy. You typically create a new
 runtime for each view controller that plans to make use of reactive motion.

 The simplest primitive of a motion runtime is a connection from a stream to a reactive property.
 Interactions are expected to create these connections when added to the runtime.

 Runtimes also act as a cache for reactive objects, ensuring that any associated reactive property
 instances are consistently used.

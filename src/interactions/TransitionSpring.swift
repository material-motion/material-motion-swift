/**
 A transition spring pulls a value from one side of a transition to another.

 A transition spring can be associated with many properties. Each property receives its own distinct
 simulator that reads the property as the initial value and pulls the value towards the destination.
 Configuration values are shared across all running instances.

 **Directionality**

 The terms `back` and `fore` are used here to refer to the backward and forward destinations,
 respectively. View controller transitions move *forward* when being presented, and *backward* when
 being dismissed. This consistency of directionality makes it easy to describe the goal states for
 a transition in a consistent manner, regardless of the direction.

 **Initial value**

 When associated with a property, this interaction will assign an initial value to the property
 corresponding to the initial direction's oposite destination. E.g. if transitioning forward, the
 property will be initialized with the `back` value.

 **Constraints**

 T-value constraints may be applied to this interaction.
